# Ballistic Calculator .Java

This is Java port of [.NET Ballistic Calculator library](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/BallisticCalculator1). Please
check the original repository for additional information about the library.

The purpose of the project is primarily keep my rudimental java skills at minimum level :-).

The package is under development now!!!

## RISK NOTICE

The application performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
